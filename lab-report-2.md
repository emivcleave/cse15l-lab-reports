# Servers and Bugs
How to set up a server and test for bugs.

## Part 1: Servers
Below is the code for `StringServer` that concatenates a string in the query of the URL to the page on a new line.
This is the example I used, with the first line being "Iced Americano" and the second being "Emi :)"

I used the imports from Wavelet (lab 2), including `Handler.class`, `Server.java`,  `ServerHttpHandler.class`, and `URLHandler.class`.
