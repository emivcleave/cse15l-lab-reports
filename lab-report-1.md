# Remote Access and FileSystem
This lab report details how to access your CSE15L-specific account and connect to the `ieng6` remote server.


## Accessing CSE15L Account
[https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

First, click the link and enter your username (UCSD email w/o @ucsd.edu) and student ID. The CSE15L account username is listed under "Additional Accounts." 
If you have set a password (that you remember) for that account, you can ignore this next section.

There is a link that says `Global Password Change Tool`. Click on that and proceed to the password change tool.
