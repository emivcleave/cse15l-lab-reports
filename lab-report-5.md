# Debugging
In this lab report, I created a mock interaction between a student and tutor that involves debugging.

## Student Question
**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

I'm using a MacBook Pro, macOS Catalina version 10.15.7, Chrome, and the VSCode built-in terminal.

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**

I decided to practice for the upcoming skill demo, but I'm stuck on step 8, which is to fix the grading script to look inside other directories for the correct file.
This is what I did:


**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**
