      6         There is a much-quoted saying, attributed to the epidemiologist Geoffrey Rose: “A large
      7         number of people exposed to a small risk may generate many more cases than a small number
      8         exposed to a very high risk.” This is true for many individual risk factors such as salt
      9         intake (linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease) and speeding on the
     10         highway (linked to injuries and accidents). Does it apply to many other global health
     11         risks? The study by Anthony Rodgers and colleagues suggests that it does.
     12         To develop effective health policies, one must understand the existing health risks and
     13         disease burdens. On a worldwide scale, this is a tough challenge. The Global Burden of
     14         Disease Database, maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), collects data from
     15         countries around the world on risk factors such as tobacco, malnutrition, childhood abuse,
     16         unsafe sex, childbirth, and cholesterol levels, as well as on disease burdens, for example
     17         depression, blindness, and diarrhea. A large group of scientists from all over the world
     18         has developed a framework to analyze these data. To compare different risks or burdens,
     19         they calculate disability-adjusted life-years, or DALYs—the number of healthy life years
     20         lost because of a particular disease or risk factor.
     21         Rodgers and colleagues used data from the WHO database for 26 risk factors and from 14
     22         epidemiological subregions of the world to calculate the proportion of
     23         risk-factor-attributable disease burden in different population subgroups defined by age,
     24         sex, and exposure level. For being underweight in childhood, for example—the leading risk
     25         factor for global loss of healthy life—they found that only 35% of the disease burden
     26         occurred in severely underweight children, the rest occurred in those only moderately
     27         underweight. The relative risks for the moderately underweight are much lower, but the
     28         number of children in that category is so large that the total attributable burden amounted
     29         to almost two-thirds of the total global burden of disease for that risk factor.
     30         The analysis confirms—and extends to a global level—previous research showing that many
     31         major health risks are important across the range of exposure levels, not just among
     32         individuals exposed to high levels of risk. It also points to risk factors that are
     33         particularly prevalent among specific populations and age groups, and for which highly
     34         targeted interventions could be effective.
     35         Despite numerous caveats and limitations of studies like this one, such analyses are
     36         essential aids in guiding the distribution of limited funds to lower the burden of life
     37         years lost to premature death and disability.

      8 Program provides many with legal advice
      9 By Darryl Richardson
     10 
     11 Monday, December 16, 2002
     12 When Shane Massello realized his former landlord was not going
     13 to return a security deposit he believed he was entitled to, his
     14 first thought was to go to court for the money. The amount
     15 involved, however, was not enough to justify bringing in a lawyer
     16 and Massello didn't know how to begin a case in small claims court.
     17 Program Information
     18 Interested in free legal advice through the program? Arrive at
     19 the Vacaville library, 1020 Ulatis Drive, at 4 p.m. on the
     20 following dates: April 23, May 7, May 21, June 4 or June
     21 18. Appointments will be taken at 4:05 p.m. The attorney visits
     22 will begin at 6 p.m and last until 8 p.m.
     23 Fortunately for Massello and other local people with similar
     24 problems, the Vacaville Public Library has a new program designed
     25 to assist people with legal questions. The Lawyer in the Library
     26 program is an offshoot of a long-standing program at the Vallejo
     27 library, which has proven to be very effective in providing people
     28 with free, unbiased advice. The Vacaville program kicked off in
     29 March and has proven to be so popular during its first two sessions
     30 that it has already expanded from one meeting per month to two.
     31 "I knew about the Vallejo program and wanted to see if it would
     32 work here," said Dick Brownell, who is coordinating the program for
     33 the library. "I knew there would be some demand for this, but I was
     34 really pleased with the turnout for the first two sessions."
     35 Because the program is just starting in Vacaville, only two
     36 attorneys are available during the two-hour sessions. Those wishing
     37 to speak to the attorneys are allowed up to 20 minutes to discuss
     38 their cases and receive advice on how to proceed.
     39 "Basically I just shoot them in the right direction," said Gene
     40 Windham, a Vacaville attorney specializing in probate and tax law
     41 who helped out earlier this week. "Sometimes the case is outside
     42 our areas, but we can at least give them some clues on if they have
     43 a case and how to go from here."
     44 Brownell said the first two programs have featured questions on
     45 almost every type of legal problem imaginable.
     46 "We have seen conflicts with neighbors, family law issues,
     47 immigration and financial problems," he said. "All kinds of things
     48 you don't need to go to court to resolve."
     49 Most of the people attending the most recent session said they
     50 were simply looking for advice on whether they have a legal case
     51 and how to proceed from here.
     52 "I'm here to get advice because I don't know what to do next,"
     53 said Charlene Jerrell of Suisun, who was seeking help with a
     54 financial issue. "I like the fact that I can find out what is and
     55 isn't available for me. The fact that an attorney will talk to me
     56 and I can ask them questions is great."
     57 Part of the agreement the participants must sign before meeting
     58 with the attorney is that the attorney is not able to serve as the
     59 person's lawyer during any action in the matter. This fact is very
     60 important to many of the participants, includ ing Massello.
     61 "It's a tremendous help," he said. "They are simply answering
     62 questions without thinking of how they can make money. It's nice to
     63 not have to worry about seeing a biased attorney."
     64 After a 10-minute meeting with Windham, Massello said the
     65 discussion was everything he hoped for.
     66 "It was excellent," he said. "I wanted to get some information
     67 on how to continue and I got more than I was expecting. It sounds
     68 like we will be able to get everything we want and then some and if
     69 the judge is in a good mood, we might get even more!" Because the
     70 Vacaville program is just starting up, Brownell said the number of
     71 people who can be seen each night is small, but plans are already
     72 in place to increase the totals. "Because we only have two
     73 attorneys per night right now, we can only see about 15 people each
     74 night," he said. "The Vallejo program has four attorneys each
     75 night, so they can see more people. It's too early to tell, but I
     76 think we will likely have another attorney here soon."
     77 Brownell also said a partnership with the Solano County Bar
     78 Association should help get the word out to attorneys who might
     79 want to donate their time.
     80 "This is a pure pro-bono project," Brownell said. "We really
     81 commend them for coming in during the evening and helping out."
     82 The initial demand for legal services was what prompted Brownell
     83 to add a second session each month. He said the plan is to hold the
     84 event on the first and third Tuesdays of each month, but the
     85 schedule is somewhat different for the next several months. The
     86 next sessions will be held on April 23, May 7 and 21 and June 4 and
     87 18.

The `-N` option adds line numbers to the beginnings of each line in the file.
This is useful for navigating both large and small files.
In the examples below I will continue to use `-N` so I can use line numbers to reference specific parts of the code block.

In the above code blocks, the first example is the same as the `-N` example while the second one is shorter, with some lines removed.
This is because `-s` removes new lines only, and the first report contains spaces in lines 1-5 and 38-40.
However, it's still useful for ease of reading to use `-s`.

     36 attorneys are available during the two-hour sessions. Those wishing
     37 to speak to the attorneys are allowed up to 20 minutes to discuss
     38 their cases and receive advice on how to proceed.
     39 "Basically I just shoot them in the right direction," said Gene
     40 Windham, a Vacaville attorney specializing in probate and tax law
     41 who helped out earlier this week. "Sometimes the case is outside
     42 our areas, but we can at least give them some clues on if they have
     43 a case and how to go from here."
     44 Brownell said the first two programs have featured questions on
     45 almost every type of legal problem imaginable.
     46 "We have seen conflicts with neighbors, family law issues,
     47 immigration and financial problems," he said. "All kinds of things
     48 you don't need to go to court to resolve."
     49 Most of the people attending the most recent session said they
     50 were simply looking for advice on whether they have a legal case
     51 and how to proceed from here.
     52 "I'm here to get advice because I don't know what to do next,"
     53 said Charlene Jerrell of Suisun, who was seeking help with a
     54 financial issue. "I like the fact that I can find out what is and
     55 isn't available for me. The fact that an attorney will talk to me
     56 and I can ask them questions is great."
     57 Part of the agreement the participants must sign before meeting
     58 with the attorney is that the attorney is not able to serve as the
     59 person's "lawyer" during any action in the matter. This fact is very
     60 important to many of the participants, includ ing Massello.
     61 "It's a tremendous help," he said. "They are simply answering
     62 questions without thinking of how they can make money. It's nice to
     63 not have to worry about seeing a biased attorney."
     64 After a 10-minute meeting with Windham, Massello said the
     65 discussion was everything he hoped for.
     66 "It was excellent," he said. "I wanted to get some information
     67 on how to continue and I got more than I was expecting. It sounds
     68 like we will be able to get everything we want and then some and if
     69 the judge is in a good mood, we might get even more!" Because the
     70 Vacaville program is just starting up, Brownell said the number of
     71 people who can be seen each night is small, but plans are already
     72 in place to increase the totals. "Because we only have two
     73 attorneys per night right now, we can only see about 15 people each
     74 night," he said. "The Vallejo program has four attorneys each
     75 night, so they can see more people. It's too early to tell, but I
     76 think we will likely have another attorney here soon."
     77 Brownell also said a partnership with the Solano County Bar
     78 Association should help get the word out to attorneys who might
     79 want to donate their time.
     80 "This is a pure pro-bono project," Brownell said. "We really
     81 commend them for coming in during the evening and helping out."
     82 The initial demand for legal services was what prompted Brownell
     83 to add a second session each month. He said the plan is to hold the
     84 event on the first and third Tuesdays of each month, but the
     85 schedule is somewhat different for the next several months. The
     86 next sessions will be held on April 23, May 7 and 21 and June 4 and
     87 18.

In this case, both "lawyer" and "Lawyer" are both highlighted during the search.
The `-I` option helps when searching documents. Sometimes we don't know exactly what we're looking for, so ignoring the case of the search term is helpful.
